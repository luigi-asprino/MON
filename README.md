# MARIO Ontology Network (MON)

This repository contains the specification of the MARIO Ontology Network (MON). 
This network aims at providing social robots with the means for creating, organising, querying and reasoning over a background knowledge base (e.g. to store/retrieve user's personal information). 
The MARIO Ontology Network (MON) is composed of different ontologies that cover different knowledge areas. 

The knowledge areas were identified by analysing the use cases that emerged from the [MARIO project](http://www.mario-project.eu/portal/). 
These uses cases mainly describe actions and behaviours featuring the MARIO robots. 
Nevertheless, they also provide us with detailed descriptions about the nature of the knowledge that the robot should deal with in order to perform and select actions and behaviours, respectively. 

Currently, the MON consists of 12 knowledge areas and 40 modules.

## Knowledge Areas

TBD

## Tracking the usage

Tracking the usage of an ontology is crucial for allowing us to measure the impact of the work.
If you use one the ontologies of the network in your project, **please** let us know it by opening an issue.
